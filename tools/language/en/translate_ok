The app My Car, formerly known as Flex Profile has been updated to solve some problems related to the old way of selecting numbers.\n This application will help you decide the most advantageous fuel at the time of supply.\n This calculation is made by cost KM/L. \ n For the same work, the supply should be \ "complete the tank to fill it \" he needs it for the correct calculation of consumption. \ n If you have migrated from the Flex Profile, the mode of operation is the same, but with improvements in data entry and also the new menu "Oil", where the user can register the vehicle oil changes. \ n For the new user, you must enter a vehicle for the calculation is made. \ n This can be done by adding a new vehicle to the application, pulling the lateral menu to the right and going to the Vehicle option. \ n Within this option the user can see a list of registered vehicles, and selecting Button \ "+ \" can add a vehicle. \ n In add vehicle, inform the car's name, fuels and their consumption and the same tank capacity in liters (if CNG, also add the cubic footage of the drum ). \ n With the registered car, enter the amount of each liter of fuel that the calculation is done automatically by modifying the price of them. \ n
